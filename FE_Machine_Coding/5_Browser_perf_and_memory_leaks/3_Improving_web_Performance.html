   Improving web performance:
       - Rendering Optimization:

        1. While write your HTML code:
            - avoiding the unnecessary elemnts/tags.
            - Try to reduce DOM size.
            - Vaildated HTML need to write
        2. CSS and Layout
            - use flexbox or grid layouts 
            - Avoid the fixed dimensions
            - use % or em or rem units for the responsive designs.
        3. Image Optimization -> 
            - compress and optimize images.
            - modern format of images WebP wheresoever supporting try to use it.
            - use responsive images like you can use brakpoints via media query or 
              picture tag -> srcset and sizes(media query)

            - load the image lazily via lazy attibutes of <img/> tag. -> not supporting by all browsers
            - can use preload or prefetch

        4. Minimise refolws and repaints:
           - use tranform property for animations and transitions -> minimise the repainting.
           - Fragments and its use case.

        5. Minimize the CSS - via minification tool
        
        6. defer the non-critical css
            - critical CSS -> required for first paint or above the fold
            - non-critical CSS -> for below fold

       - Javascript Optimization:
        1. use defer or async for the external JS files
        2. Use code splitting of your JS files
        3. Minify the javascript
        4. Use fragments
        5. code clean - > taking care of memory leakage problems
        6. Use CDN -> for your heavy assests -> images/SVGS/audio/videos -> can use AWS cloudfront CDN for 
                    putting your heavy assests there only
        7. use memoization.
