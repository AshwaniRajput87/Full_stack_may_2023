       - It's browser API to store data locally at the client(means on your browser).
       - usecase:
          - store the information for user preferences.
          - session data
          - persist the refresh token
          - re-direction url with data.
          - cached content.

               - the data persist after closing of the browser.
               - localStorage.setItem(key, value) - for persisting the data in localstorage.
               - localStorage.getItem(key) - get the value correspond to that key
               - localStorage.removeItem(key) - to remove particular key data only.
               - localStorage.clear() - to remove whole data from localStorage.

           2. session storage:
               - similar to local storage, stores key-value pair data on a user's device.
               - but the data persist till the session of the browser window/tab. 
               - sessionStorage.setItem(key, value) - for persisting the data in localstorage.
               - sessionStorage.getItem(key) - get the value correspond to that key
               - sessionStorage.removeItem(key) - to remove particular key data only.
               - sessionStorage.clear() - to remove whole data from localStorage.
