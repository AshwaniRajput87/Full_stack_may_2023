   Network Optimization:
      - a process of enhancing the efficiency and performance of a network 
         to ensure that the loading of a web page intially becomes faster.

      - strategies:
         1. To optimize the resorces on network - Use intersection Observer
         2. Minification: use the tool to minify HTML, CSS, JS, images and video
         3. Compression: gzip
             -> reduce the size of data before transmission, that saves bandwidth and improves the web performance.
         4. caching -> CDN (Content Delivery Network) -> make copies of data  or resources temporarily to speed up 
             the access and reduce the initial load of your web page.

            It delivers content to users from the closest servers, that speeds up
            the website loading time.

            When a user requests a resource (like an image or a webpage), the CDN
            routes the request to the nearest server.
