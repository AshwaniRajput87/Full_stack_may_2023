    HTTP
     - HyperText Transfer Protocol
     - a data communication protocol on the web
     - It helps to define how clients(your browsers)  make a request and getting back the response from server.
       1. Request and response cycle: 
           - making a request via browser url and getting response back from server on you client browser.
      2. HTTP methods:
          GET -> for getting the resources (like HTML, CSS, JS, images, videos)
          POST -> for submitting the data on server
          PUT -> to update the data on server
          DELETE -> when user want to delete the data and update on the server
          PATCH -> apply, partial modifications to a resource.
    3. HTTP status code:
         - indicate the outcome of the resources.
         
            1XX -> informational responses
            2XX ->  success reponses
            3XX -> redirection responses
            4XX -> client errors -> as FE dev you need to fix such errors
            5XX -> Server errors -> as BE dev you need to fix such errors
    4. HTTP Headers:
        - helps to send the extra infromation to server.
        - extra info -> your access token to authorise the REST APIs call.
                     -> send the user context info
